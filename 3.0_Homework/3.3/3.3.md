先看 fork 调用的 do_fork ，除了 SIGCHLD 参数外，有三个
参数就是空手而来，有两个参数似乎也没有明确的目标。
但作为子进程，它完全有自己的个性的，根本不想共享
父进程的任何资源，而是让父亲把他所有资源给自己复
制一份，父亲真的就给他复制一份吗，老爸没有那么傻，
而是假装复制了一下，也就是用一个指针指过去而已，
等真正需要的时候，比如，要写一个页面，这时，写时
复制技术就登场了， 只有父子进程中不管谁想写一个页
面时，这个页面才被复制一份。


When a fork() system call is issued, a copy of all the pages corresponding to the parent process is created, loaded into a separate memory location by the OS for the child process. But this is not needed in certain cases. Consider the case when a child executes an "exec" system call (which is used to execute any executable file from within a C program) or exits very soon after the fork(). When the child is needed just to execute a command for the parent process, there is no need for copying the parent process' pages, since exec replaces the address space of the process which invoked it with the command to be executed.

In such cases, a technique called copy-on-write (COW) is used. With this technique, when a fork occurs, the parent process's pages are not copied for the child process. Instead, the pages are shared between the child and the parent process. Whenever a process (parent or child) modifies a page, a separate copy of that particular page alone is made for that process (parent or child) which performed the modification. This process will then use the newly copied page rather than the shared one in all future references. The other process (the one which did not modify the shared page) continues to use the original copy of the page (which is now no longer shared). This technique is called copy-on-write since the page is copied when some process writes to it.
